# Iris programming language

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Iris is a lightweight dynamic programming language with a functional core and support for OOP.

It was created purely for learning about programming language design with clear goals in mind:

* Simple syntax
* Functions are closures
* Implicit return values
* Everything is an expression

Practising design paradigms and version control is also a side goal of this project.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* [x] Add self-evaluating expressions
* [x] Add basic operations
* [x] Add variable support (declare, assign)
* [x] Add (nested) function scope support with identifier resolution
* [x] Add control flow
* [x] Add loops
* [x] Add (native) functions

More will be added as the project progresses.
